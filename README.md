For this application's GUI, it is used JavaFX 17 and all dependencies needed for the database connection including the JavaFX itself are included in pom.xml file.

First step is to run the sql scripts included in the Scripts folder. BCdataScript.sql first and then ProceduresAndTrigger.sql next(which include all the necessary tables and a couple of procedures and a trigger).
